*bufjump.txt*

Experimental buffer navigation. Basically EasyMotion for buffers.

*bufjump#select()*

	Select a buffer.

	Example mappings:
>
	nnoremap <leader>b  :call bufjump#select()<CR>
	nnoremap <CR>       :call bufjump#select()<CR>
	nnoremap \          :call bufjump#select()<CR>
	nnoremap <nowait> Z :call bufjump#select()<CR>
<
*g:bufjump_chars*

	Characters used for hashing.

	|String|, non-empty
	Default: 'fjghdkslaeiruwoqpytbnvmcxz' ~

*g:bufjump_algorithm*

	- With value 0 hashes have variable length and require confirmation
	  with <CR>.
	- With value larger than 0 hashes have fixed length and you have to
	  always make that amount of key presses to select a buffer.

	|Number|, 0 or greater
	Default: 2 ~

*g:bufjump_ignorecase*

	- 0: off
	- 1: ignore case for [a-z] characters
	- 2: ignore case for all characters (% is 5, ? is /, + is =)

	|Number|, between 0 and 2
	Default: 1 ~

TODO: ~
	- expose hashing function for use in statusline or bufferline
	- split bufjump#select() into two functions/commands, displaying and
	  selection. like :ls and :b
	- don't display inaccessible buffers for algorithm > 0
	- colors
